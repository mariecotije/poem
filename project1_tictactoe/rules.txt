 rules: https://pyladies.at/2023/pyladies-en-vienna-2023-spring/beginners-en/tictactoe/

You plan your 1D tic-tac-toe on a board that has one row with 20 spaces.

There are two players. The first player makes a move by placing an x into an empty space.
The second player places an o. Then the first player plays again.

For example:

move: -------x------------
move: -------x--o---------
move: -------xx-o---------
move: -------xxoo---------
move: ------xxxoo---------
The player who places three of their own marks next to each other wins.

Your task is to program the game!
